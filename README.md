# Advent of Code Bun Template

This repository provides a TypeScript template for solving Advent of Code puzzles using Bun as its package manager/test runner. It includes commands for running your solutions, scaffolding new days, and downloading puzzle inputs.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun#install) should be installed on your system.
- A valid session cookie saved in a `.adventofcode.session` file in your home directory. This is required for the `download` command to fetch puzzle inputs from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).  
To get this, press F12 anywhere on the Advent of Code website to open your browser developer tools. Look in your Cookies under the Application or Storage tab, and copy out the session cookie value.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new repository
Click the "Use this template" button located near the top-right corner of the template repository.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd <your-repo>
   bun install
   ```

## Usage

### Scaffolding a New Day

To create the folder structure for a new day's puzzle, use the following command:

```bash
bun scaffold <day>
```

Replace `<day>` with the day number (e.g., `bun scaffold 1` for Day 1).  
This will create a `src/day` folder with a `01.ts` file with a function for each part and a corresponding `01.test.ts` file.
It will also create an empty `01.txt` file in `src/example` that you will need to populate yourself.

### Download Puzzle Input

To fetch the puzzle input for a specific day, use the following command:

```bash
bun download <day> [year]
```

You can optionally specify the year you want to download if you're not doing the latest AOC.  
This command will download the puzzle input for the specified day and save it to a file in the corresponding `src/input` folder.

### Scaffold and download shortcut

You can use `generate` to scaffold the files and download the input at the same time.

```bash
bun generate <day> [year]
```

### Solving a Puzzle

To solve a puzzle, create a TypeScript file (e.g., `day1.ts`) in the corresponding day's folder and write your solution code. You can then run the following command to execute your solution:

```bash
bun solve <day>
```

Replace `<day>` with the day number (e.g., `bun solve 1` for Day 1). This command will execute the TypeScript file for that day and display the solutions.

### Running the tests

```bash
bun test <day>
```

The tests generated by the template start with the day so you can filter them (single digit days are padded with a 0). By not specifying the day your can them all at the same time.
